        My name is Shreyansh.  I am just 12 years old. I was born in Hajipur and grew up in Hajipur only. I am currently a student of std 6th.
         I am doing my schooling at St. Paul's High School.
         I have interest in Cricket and Coding.
         Cricket lies in my every heartbeat. I am a hard working and creative person. I am such a perfect guy that everyone  remember me after our first meeting.

        <center> <font size = ' 08 '> <b> <h2> Why I started coding? </font> </b> </h2> </center>  
         It's all about having  interest and passion of doing something creative and I was having that interest and passion in me to do something creative and interesting.
         <center> <font size = ' 08 '> <b> <h2> How I started coding? </font> </b> </h2> </center>  
         So, after all that passion and interest. firstly I didnâ€™t know  What is this Coding and Why is it used.  My Brother made me understood about coding and why is it used. He told me that "Coding is the method of giving a computer instructions to perform a specific task or coding is also referred to as software programming or computer programming. These instructions are only communicated using a language that computers can understand, like visual blocks, JavaScript, Python, HTML, and CSS." From that moment I started researching about coding and I got to know that for coding I firstly have to learn about HTML. And from then I started coding.
